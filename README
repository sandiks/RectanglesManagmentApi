Overview
Web based API is needed to perform a search/match of each coordinate passed as input based on established sets of rectangles.

Feel free to ask as many or as few questions about the requirements as you feel are necessary.

Any code should maintain best practices, and have the ability to scale to meet load.

Please push the code up into an accessible repository of your choice.

Before moving on to Bonus Point items, please make sure the Basic Requirements are completed to your satisfaction.
Basic Requirements
Your application must:
Contain data seed methods to populate 200 rectangle data entries into database
Each data entry (and therefore row(s)) must define rectangle coordinates and/or dimensions, upon your choice of design
Define an endpoint that takes an array of coordinates upon your choice of design of input object
For each passed coordinate, output a list of rectangles defined in database that this coordinate falls into
Bonus Points
Implement automated tests using tools of your choice.
Database makes use of indexes and foreign keys.
Implement basic authentication of the caller of API.
Any further design considerations assuming scaling this system and integrations with external consumers.
Wrap the executable(s) into Docker container.
